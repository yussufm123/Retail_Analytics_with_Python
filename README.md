### **Quantium Virtual Internship - Retail Strategy and Analytics**

#### **Part 1: Data Preparation & Customer Analytics**
In this project I analyzed retail transaction data for a major chip manufacturer to identify high-value customer segments and provide data-driven recommendations. I performed data preparation, customer analytics, and segmentation analysis to understand which customer groups contribute most to chip sales and why.
